		<h5>Internship Journey:</h5>
			<p>
				The internship was on <em><strong>Python programming </strong></em>. I learnt about Python software installation, environment setup followed by familiarization to variables and differnet types of inputs. Then I got to learn about operators like arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignment, identity operator, membership operators, bitwise operator.
				Then I got to learn about the use of pass to skip that part when you havent decided what to be done in that step/ condition.I was also taught about list,tuple, dictionary and sets. The use of zip and enumerate functions were also taaught in a very easy to understand manner.I was told that zip is used to associate the items with values and enclose them together, whereas enumerate function is used to give number to item.  
			</p>
			<p>
				I learnt about importance of data structures and also about the commom errors during pyhthon imstallation and package installations.
			</p>
			<p>
				I learnt to write programs to create different patterns and alos do data entry for different situations and aslo learnt to use the date and time stamp.
			</p>
			<p>
				I learnt to encrypt and decrypt a message and also make a lucky draw concept. All this has made me mpre familiar to the basic concepts of pythom pragramming.
